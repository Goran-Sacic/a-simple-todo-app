# Introduction

Welcome to the GitHub pages of my own personal Todo app! This app serves as a simple Task tracker. [There are many like it, but this one is mine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifleman%27s_Creed).

## Installation

In order to test the app, you can utilize the following procedures:

- Visit the app at [https://a-simple-todo-app-gs.netlify.app/](https://a-simple-todo-app-gs.netlify.app/).

- For developers, open your IDE and use the following commands:
  git clone https://github.com/Goran-Sacic/a-simple-todo-app.git
  npm i
  npm run dev
  open app at http://localhost:5173/

## Features

The following features are implemented:

- on first app start, three default tasks are always displayed. By pressing 'Reset' button app reverts to default state
- you can add a new task by inputting value inside of a "What needs to be done?" field, and then pressing Enter or clicking 'Add' button. Tasks added in this way are colored black
- alternatively, you can add a random number of tasks from an outside source! Whole numbers 1-10 are allowed. Tasks added in this way are colored blue
- completed tasks are striked-through with lowered visibility
- 'Clear list' button deletes all tasks
- 'Delete random tasks' button deletes only random tasks added from an outside source
- 'Delete custom tasks' deletes custom added tasks
- 'Reset' button reverts entire app to default settings
- app utilizes local storage, so there is no backing of data if you lose your local items! This will be fixed in a future update

## Upcoming updates

The following are upcoming app updates (ranked by priority):

- authentication and backend integration (ETA: end of August, 2024)
- todo tracking per month (ETA: September, 2024)
- better color palette and responsiveness (ETA: September, 2024)
